# Grid-forming control of MMC
Here's group project for three master students @KTH who are keen on grid integration and MMC.
*Language*: MATLAB - Simulink - Simscape - Specialized Power system (May be further discussed laterðŸ˜Š) 
*Supervisor*: Dr. Yang Zhang and Prof. Qianwen Xu

## Objective:
 - Understand the topology and control structure of MMC and its basic operation principles
 - Investigate existing grid-forming control strategies
 - Develop a simulation model of a grid-connected MMC with grid-forming control
 - Demonstrate the performance of the MMC with grid-forming control on developed simulation model or scaled-down prototype
 - Analyze and compare the performance of grid-forming control with conventional grid-following control
 - The students will also have the chance to build a scaled-down MMC hardware prototype or some hardware modules with the materials provided by supervisors
